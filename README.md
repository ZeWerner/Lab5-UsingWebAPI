### Error Time Line 

An error occured with the properties I created for the joke class. I had flag meta as a list, thinking each index would contain the bool value of the flags. I hence changed it to an object that has each bool value as a properties.

Another error occured when I had the property error assigned to a string while the Json returned it as a bool. 

I had many small errors while creating a url for the GetAsync method due to punctuation changing based on various user selections. I fixed this with various if statments and other checks 

A majority of my other errors were caused from my switch statement
